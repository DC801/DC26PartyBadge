# DC801 Badge Software

We hope you enjoyed the badge this year.  We're very excited this year to have worked with our friends in #badgelife to develop a cross-badge communications platform.

The badge this year had these software features:

 - Ability to play videos from the SD card
 - Multiple games to play including a UART game
 - A bootloader that includes system checks and UART updating (hold A button while powering on)
